\usage{
FixZeros(SE, group_colname, remove.sparse.features = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{SE}{a SummarizedExperiment object of gene/abundance counts.}

\item{group_colname}{a string specifying the column name in the colData(SE)
representing the sample group.}

\item{remove.sparse.features}{a logical argument (TRUE/FALSE) for removal of
features with a sum of zero counts exceeding the size of the smallest
sample group and for replacing the remaining zeros. Default is TRUE.}
}
\value{
a SummarizedExperiment object with adjusted zeros. Features with a sum of zero counts
exceeding the smallest sample group size are removed and the remaining zeros are replaced.
}
\description{
This function detects zero/negative values and replaces them
in a SummarizedExperiment object. In the first step, it checks for the presence
of zero and negative values. Next, features with zero counts surpassing the
threshold set by the size of smallest sample group are removed. Subsequently,
the remaining zeros are substituted with the minimal positive values observed
for each feature across all samples.

\examples{
{
# Assuming you have a SummarizedExperiment object and relevant metadata column
SE_fixed = FixZeros(SE = some_SE_object, group_colname = "diagnosis")
}
